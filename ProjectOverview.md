# Project1
Project overview / Project Plans

The Project plan will define how the project will be executed


Project definition/High Level Design: Define the requirements or features of the project.
Exactly what we want to accomplish or what use cases we will serve (In the order of priority)? 
What? : Given a pool of players (with projected point values) and budgetary constraints calculate
an optimal roaster (list of athletes).
How? The application reads players and their projected point values and budgetary constraints data from
CSV file, performs an analysis and makes a roaster proposal.
Technical design: 
what algorithm to use to calculate a roaster? 
Do we need to store data inside a database or is it enough to read and write from CSV file?(applies to the
overall project)
What? : As players start to perform in the real games, capture players’ actual performance 
How? : The application reads player’s actual performance from a CSV file or from external source
3rd party API) and update player information with the real performance data. 
Technical Design 
What? : As players performance data is captured from real world, the application will able 
to make recommendations about add/drop/trade players.
How? : Define project team.
As a team, define the list of tasks that need to be accomplished 
to complete the project requirements (including estimation, and assign tasks to project 
members and define a project plan with this information.
